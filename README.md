# OTT Platform Design with Angular

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an OTT platform using Angular while adhering to Angular's best practices. The platform incorporates reusable and scalable architecture, robust data handling, and an attractive user interface to enhance user experience.

---

## Key Features

1. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - The application is structured into reusable, modular components to ensure scalability and maintainability.

2. **Strict Data Handling**
   - Used a `model.ts` file to define data structures for type safety and strictness.

3. **Constants Management**
   - Included a `constants.ts` file to define constant values that are used across the project, ensuring consistency and easy updates.

4. **Pagination**
   - Implemented pagination to efficiently handle large datasets and improve performance.

5. **Search Functionality**
   - Added a dynamic search feature to allow users to quickly find content.

6. **Custom Design**
   - Designed a custom, visually appealing UI to enhance user engagement.

7. **API Integration**
   - Fetched data from the provided API to display content dynamically.

8. **Performance Optimization**
   - Followed Angular best practices such as onPush change detection, lazy loading of modules, and efficient handling of DOM updates to ensure optimal performance.

### 3. Constants File
- Defined reusable constants in `constants.ts`:

### 4. Pagination
- Created a pagination component to manage large datasets efficiently.

### 5. Search Functionality
- Implemented a search bar with two-way data binding to filter movies dynamically based on user input.

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- Minimized API calls with caching strategies.
